# LAMP Benchmark
A series of tests/benchmars across multiple high-level linear algebra oriented languages/libraries/frameworks (we are going to use the term languages from now on)
that assess to what extent said languages translate high-level linear algebra expressions to high performance code.

More details can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09421):
